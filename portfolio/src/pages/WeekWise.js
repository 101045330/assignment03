                        Please double check your STU-VIEW to ensure that you have the up-to-date class schedule, and you should now have access to the up-to-date version of the course outline via D2L Brightspace. Kindly review your syllabus to familiarize yourself with the week-by-week schedule (subject to change with notice).

                        We have three (3) hours allotted to each weekly session, and you can expect to spend a couple of hours with me synchronously as we navigate 1) high level concepts that anchor our work and 2) practical exercises that involve the use of web-based software. During the weeks when there are impending assignment deadlines or quizzes instead of practical exercises, however, you may have more flexibility in terms of how you spend your time during our session.

                    <p>
                        Recording: I personally specialize in remote-only learning and intend to record all our sessions despite our course being in-person, but please be advised that 1) your attendance is expected especially for sessions that feature practical exercises, and 2) these recording are meant for those who have academic accommodation. While I am open to sharing these session recordings with those who have extenuating circumstances and wish to play catch-up, let us take advantage of the excellent on-campus lab as our building is a wonderful place for brainstorming and crafting.

                    <p>
                        We are going to be dealing with a number of lightweight, multi-platform software applications (Google Chrome, Visual Studio Code, etc.). That means that there is no need for a powerful laptop / workstation for this course, 
                        although we should have access to lab computers as appropriate. You are welcome to use your own machines as needed, as long as you have access to Google Chrome (or any other Chromium-based web browser).
